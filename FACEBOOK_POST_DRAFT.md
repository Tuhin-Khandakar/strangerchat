**Option 2: Personal Story**

Hey friends! 👋

I've been working on a project lately to bring back the magic of the early internet—when you could just talk to someone without worrying about likes, followers, or your "personal brand."

It's called **STRNGR**. It's a simple, anonymous chat app.

I built it with safety and privacy as the top priorities. There's no login, no tracking, and strong moderation to keep things friendly. It works great on your phone too!

I'd love for you to test it out. Click "Start Chatting" and see who you meet.
